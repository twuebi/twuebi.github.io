My name is Tobias. I am a MA student on a fasttrack to a PhD curriculum at the [SFB833 A3](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/collaborative-research-centers/sfb-833/research-projects/section-a-context/a3-hinrichsde-kok.html) at the Eberhard Karls University of TÃ¼bingen. Before I joined the A3 project I worked at the [T1](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/collaborative-research-centers/sfb-833/research-projects/knowledge-transfer-t1/) project of the SFB. 

My research interests include neural Sequence to Sequence models and distributional semantics with its practical application in the form of word vectors. I believe that moving away from computing word vectors ahead of time and viewing tokens embedded in their context is an exciting development and should be explored further. 

I used to program a lot with Java. Nowadays I like Rust and sometimes Python for convenience.
